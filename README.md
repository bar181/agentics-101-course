# 📋 **Executive Summary**

**Contribution Team:** Bradley Ross, Nicholas Ruest, Robert Ye, Reuven Cohen, Robert Ranson
**Original Release Date:** December 2025 (version 2.0)
**Status:** Ready for Global Distribution

### **The Problem**

Most beginners use AI like a slot machine — type a prompt, hope something useful comes out.
This leads to inconsistent results, poor code quality, and frustration.

### **The Agentics Solution**

Agentics 101 teaches **Specification-Driven Development**, a structured workflow where students act as **Product Managers for AI**.
You learn to write precise specifications that force AI agents to generate reliable, maintainable output.

### **The Stack (100% Free Tools)**

* **Claude.ai** = The Brain
* **GitHub Web** = The Body
  No credit card. No installs. No APIs.

### **The Outcome**

By the end, students produce:

* A **working AI coding agent**
* A **live deployed website**
* A **GitHub portfolio**
* **Professional documentation & safety protocols**

This course democratizes the most important beginner skill in AI automation:
**spec writing + agent supervision.**

# 📚 **Course Structure (Full Module Breakdown)**

Total Time: ~6 hours
Deliverables: Working AI Agent • Live Website • Portfolio-Ready Repo • Safety Docs

---

## **Module 0 — Welcome & Pre-Flight (15 min)**

A fast orientation to the tools, goals, and structure.
You learn:

* Why agentic engineering matters
* How Claude + GitHub will act as your development environment
* The mindset shift from “AI user” to “AI supervisor”

---

## **Module 1 — Meet Your First Agent (45 min)**

You build a **10-line micro-spec** — your first blueprint for AI.
You learn:

* How specs remove ambiguity
* How agents interpret structured instructions
* How to define WHAT to build (not HOW to code)

---

## **Module 2 — From Chaos to Control (60 min)**

You transform vague ideas into precise engineering requirements.
You learn:

* How to enhance specs with exact colors, sizes, behaviors
* How specificity increases output reliability
* How to turn randomness into predictable code

Deliverable: **Your first enhanced specification file.**

---

## **Module 3 — Your Sandbox (45 min)**

You set up a real GitHub repository — the home for your project.
You learn:

* GitHub file structure for agent projects
* How to manage specs, outputs, docs
* How to prepare a safe, agent-friendly workspace

Deliverable: **Public GitHub repo with specs + structure.**

---

## **Module 4 — Build Your Coding Agent (90 min)**

The main event.
You instruct Claude to read your spec and generate a complete working website.

You learn:

* How to write a **system prompt** that converts Claude into a coding agent
* How to review code quality through a 5-step verification pattern
* How to iterate with **directive feedback** (exact numerical changes)
* How to paste, commit, and test your generated website

Deliverable: **Working index.html file + verified agent workflow.**

---

## **Module 5 — Safety & Polish (60 min)**

You shift from “it works” to “it works safely and professionally.”

You learn:

* The **Three Laws of Agent Safety**

  1. Human Approval Required
  2. Bounded Scope
  3. Read Before Write
* How to create **SAFETY.md**
* How to write a **portfolio-grade README**
* How to deploy your live site through GitHub Pages

Deliverables:

* SAFETY.md
* Professional README
* Live public site URL

---

## **Module 6 — Your Path Forward (30 min)**

You map your future as an Agentic Engineer.

You learn:

* How to scale to multi-file specs
* How to build your **second agent** (docs agent, testing agent, or refactor agent)
* How to join the Agentics community
* How to develop a **30-day growth plan**

Deliverable: **Personal roadmap + second agent project outline.**

---

# 🚀 **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this course, you can:

* Write precise, engineering-grade specifications
* Direct AI systems to produce reliable code
* Review, approve, and supervise agentic workflows
* Document projects at a professional standard
* Deploy real web applications
* Build and extend AI-supported development workflows

And most importantly:
**You think and operate like an Agentic Engineer.**

---

# 🧠 **Why Agentic Engineering Matters**

The future of software is not “AI writing code.”
The future is **humans supervising fleets of AI agents** using structured, safe, repeatable processes.

Agentics 101 gives you the foundation for:

* Agent orchestration
* Automated development pipelines
* AI-assisted engineering roles
* Future advanced courses (Agentics 201, 301, etc.)

This is the literacy layer the world is missing.
